great!!! now it shows all users, but what missing is that all users got 0 score printed, some of them have scores tho. and one another important thing, i git this error message when i tried to enter HIGH SCORES page 

Encountered two children with the same key, ``. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates. Non-unique keys may cause children to be duplicated and/or omitted — the behavior is unsupported and could change in a future version. 8 react-dom-client.development.js:6604:23
